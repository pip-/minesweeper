minesweeper
===========

A simple Minesweeper-like game I made for class in 2014.

Not my best attempt at programming minesweeper. I would go on
to recreate this a year later in Javascript. You can find that
project here: https://github.com/pip-/minesweeper-js

Compile with make, launch with command line.
